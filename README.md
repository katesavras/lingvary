# Lingvary

Lingvary is an app for learning English words.  
You can add  words in your dictionary. Then you can go to practice and choose  
what kind of language you want to see in the cards for practicing Russian or English.  
If you don`t remember the translation of  a word, you can use the hint.  
This simple app will help you quickly and easily expand your vocabulary.
